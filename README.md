# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Module 19 Challenge

#### by Christopher Madden

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. We'll discuss the background and history of computational neurons as well as current implementations of neural networks as they apply to deep learning. We'll discuss the major costs and benefits of different neural networks and compare these costs to traditional machine learning classification and regression models. Additionally, we'll practice implementing neural networks and deep neural networks across a number of different datasets, including image, natural language, and numerical datasets. Finally, we'll learn how to store and retrieve trained models for more robust uses.

To complete the challenge, one must be able to:
- Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
- Describe the perceptron model and its components.
- Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
- Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
- Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
- Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
- Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
- Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.

## Results

**Data Preprocessing**

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
